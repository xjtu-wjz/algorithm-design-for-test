一首很喜欢的诗，把算法讲成了poem。

```
Can't write "just like that"
with no preconceived structure
a point, consistent style
it hurts when words don't fit
and from the lines stick out.

Second thought on the rhyme,
thought that rubs in the side.

Here goes though, giving it a try.
Trying proves I haven't yet died.
I just wish the algo would stop
trying to make me fit statistically
expected way to write!

It hasn't been to the same niches,
so it should just point out the cliches
```
